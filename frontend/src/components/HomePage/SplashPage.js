      Macro tracking is a popular method of tracking food intake that involves monitoring the consumption of macronutrients: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. By tracking the number of grams of each macronutrient consumed each day, individuals can gain a better understanding of their overall nutrient intake and adjust their diet to meet their specific goals, whether it be building muscle, losing fat, or maintaining a healthy weight.

      Each macronutrient provides the body with a different type of energy and has different effects on the body. Protein, for example, is essential for building and repairing muscle tissue, while carbohydrates provide the body with energy for physical activity and brain function. Fat is important for hormone production, cellular function, and energy storage.
